                  Throughout its history, the USLS Ecopark has encountered
                  challenges deriving from severe weather events, notably
                  flooding induced by heavy rainfall and inadequate water
                  management systems. The park is facing the relentless
                  onslaught of typhoons, characterized by ferocious winds and
                  inundation, which have posed significant hurdles in
                  maintaining the delicate ecological equilibrium within its
                  bounds. Furthermore, periods of drought have compounded these
                  difficulties, necessitating the implementation of innovative
                  water conservation strategies.

                <p class="in-response-to">
                  In response to these urgent challenges, the USLS Ecopark has
                  not only grappled with immediate operational disruptions but
                  has also embarked on a continuous journey of adaptation and
                  resilience-building against the impacts of climatic extremes.
                  This dynamic context underscores the imperative for a
                  comprehensive examination of the factors contributing to these
                  challenges and, crucially, the strategic interventions
                  conducted to address and mitigate them, thus paving the way
